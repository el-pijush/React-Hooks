Hooks

We were previously known to react stateless components now , lets introduce hooks which allows us
to use rect state. We also name them function components.
Hooks dont work inside classes, but we can use them instead of classes 

What is a hook?
Hook is a special component that lets you "hook into" react features. For exapmple react useState hook lets you 
add state into react function components.

when do we use hook??'
If you use a function component you can see that you need to add some state to it. previously we used to do it using
class now we use state directly to it
